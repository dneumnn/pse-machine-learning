# Classical Machine Learning

There is a long history of algorithms we summarize as classical machine learning:

- 1896: [Linear Regression](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10691898.2001.11910537#:~:text=Although%20Pearson%20did%20develop%20a,notions%20of%20correlation%20and%20regression.) Pearson published his first rigorous treatment of correlation and regression
- 1936: [Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis) a data dimensionality reduction algorithm introduced by R. A. Fisher.
- 1943: [Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) The perceptron was invented in 1943 by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts.The first implementation was a machine built in 1958 by Frank Rosenblatt. 
- 1944: [Logistic Regression](https://papers.tinbergen.nl/02119.pdf) predicts the probability of a data point having a positive label with a clear defined model by Joseph Berkson over many decades, beginning in Berkson 1944.
- 1950: [Naive Bayes Classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier). Based on the core idea of Bayes decision theory, which is to select the decision with the highest probability, the Bayes classifier was born and divides the sample into the class with the highest posterior probability.
- 1951: [k-Nearest-Neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) algorithm is a non-parametric supervised method. It can solve both classification and regression problems with high accuracy in low dimensional spaces, but slow with many samples. 
- 1959: [Decision Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) Classification or regression decision trees are used as a predictive model to draw conclusions about a set of observations. The first approach dates back to 1959 and a British researcher, William Belson, in a paper titled Matching and Prediction on the Principle of Biological Classification. 
- 1964: [Support Vector Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine). SVMs are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis. The original SVM algorithm was invented by Vladimir N. Vapnik and Alexey Ya. Chervonenkis.

We will not cover all these algorithms, but we will have a look at some of them.
