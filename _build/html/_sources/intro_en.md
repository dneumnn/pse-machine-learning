# PSE-ML - Machine Learning with Python

PSE-ML is part of the master degree program **[professional software engineering](https://www.weiterbildung-reutlingen-university.de/academic-education/master/professional-software-engineering-msc-hybrid/)** at the **Knowledge Foundation @ Reutlingen University**.

In this course we introduce the foundations of Machine Learning for software engineers. Our focus is on software development. We believe that Machine Learning will be an essential tool in the software engineer's toolbox.

The success of Artificial Intelligence is largely based on classical **Machine Learning**. After the second AI winter **Deep Learning** was the rising star. And today there are **Large Language Models**. A Large Language Model is a large generative AI language model. It is based on neural networks with Transformer architecture and is capable of understanding, processing and generating natural language.

The **software naturalness hypothesis** [On the Naturalness of Software](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/suz/publications/natural.pdf) proclaims that Software could be treated like a natural language and therefore next-word-predictors for Software could change the way we build software in the near future.

Examples are

- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot),
- [CodeBERT](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeBERT#),
- [Replit](https://replit.com),
- [Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex) but also
- [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt).

Currently, the fields of artificial intelligence and software development are growing together or coevolves in two ways:

1. machine learning is used to train algorithms from data that can be used in and as software programs. This means the program is not explicitly coded, rules are not known a priory, and
2. specially trained Large Language Models are used to generate software artifacts. Here the fact that a code can be treated like a natural language is key. [The Software Naturalness hypothesis argues that programming languages can be understood through the same techniques used in natural language processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12641).

In this lecture, we will cover the underlying concepts and selected methods and techniques in classical machine learning and deep learning. We are not only interested in understanding how a problem can be addressed with which machine learning model, but also how these models have a lasting impact on our core domain, **software development**. We will explore and evaluate different possible applications.

Successful completion of the module should ensure that students have acquired an overview of the various methods and tools from classical machine learning and deep learning and are able to apply them. This also includes that the students are able to make decisions, which technology and method seems to be suitable under the given problem.
