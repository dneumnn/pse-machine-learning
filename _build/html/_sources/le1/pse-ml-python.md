# Python Introduction

[Python]( https://www.python.org) is an object-oriented, interpreted and untyped programming language with a long [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python). Conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum.

In 2023 Python is one of the [top 3 most popular programming languages](https://www.stackscale.com/blog/most-popular-programming-languages/).

To understand the pytonic-way of programming it makes sense to read the [styleguide for formatting python code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and the [Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/).

Because there are many good introductions to the Python programming language available on the internet, we will give only a short introduction. For more information please read:
