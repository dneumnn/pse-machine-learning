# Three Types of Machine Learning

We distiguish machine learning into three different types:

- Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, we have labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.
- Unsupervised Learning: In unsupervised learning, we only have datasets without labels. But we are interested in the hidden structure of our data and try to learn hidden patterns exclusively from unlabeled data. E.g. we could cluster the data or reduce the dimension of its features.
- Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning is concerned with how intelligent agents take actions in an environment in order to maximize their reward function.

In this lecture we focus on supervised and unsupervised learning and not on reinforcement learning.
